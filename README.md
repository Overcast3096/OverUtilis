## Over's Utils

A collection of various tools, calculators, and training I found to be useful for personal use, but are also publically available.

In theory, at least.

This site is also a place for me to play around with react, and see what I can do with it.

The site itself can (eventually) be found [here](https://overcast.space). Currently it's only a redirect, but eventually will host all the info the card site has.
